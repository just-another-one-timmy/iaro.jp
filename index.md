# Hi

This is my personal web site.
My name written in different languages is:

* *Ukrainian* - Ярослав Тимченко
* *English* - Iaroslav Tymchenko
* *Japanese* - ヤロスラフ チムチェンコ

## A short TODO list for myself would include:
+ Create simple static site generator for people like me, so I could easily update this site
+ Collect interesting links from the web, like:
    + [Go!Go!7188 lyrics & translations](http://www.jelliajamb.com/gogo7188/lyrics.php?gogo)
    + A good song to cover (Deep Purple - Stormbringer): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vUbqx6Wzb8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vUbqx6Wzb8)
+ Some links about me:
    + github: [https://github.com/just-another-one-timmy](https://github.com/just-another-one-timmy)
    + this site: [http://iaro.jp](http://iaro.jp) or [http://timmy.tokyo](http://timmy.tokyo)
+ A list of books I've read with some comments from me:
    + The pragmatic programmer
    + Coders at work
    + to be continued (need to create the site generator ...)
